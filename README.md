# Team Conventions

## Workflow Management

This team is using the Kanban method as the workflow management system. Because of the flexibility Kanban offers. As the whole team is responsible for the project management board, we thought that Kanban is the best practice to use. In terms of distribution of tasks, we ensure that the 'in progress' column is completed before we add additional tasks to it. If there was a bottleneck for whatever reason, other team members can pitch in and support the development of the task even if their roles are different.

## Code reviews

We have created a GitHub rule which allows major code changes to be merged into main branch only if the individual has submitted a pull request via GitHub and their code has been reviewed & approved by at least 2 members of the team.

## Team Ceremonies

We have a weekly 30 minute video calls to go over the changes of roles within the team as well as maintain the board. In these 30 minutes sessions we also go over any aspects that needs to be clarified within the team or passed to the originator.
